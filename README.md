# Welcome to my Simulation Methods for Actuaries project, in a group with two other students.

This project applied the principles seen during the theoretical part of the course :
1. Cleaning and filtering data
2. Choosing pertinent variables
3. Analysis of current data, and fitting to distributions
4. Prediction of future data through mathematical models and raw simulation

You will find in the files :
1. the dataset in csv format : it is an insurance portfolio with multiple claims per insured
2. The (commented) R code required to clean the data, visualize the data, and simulate the data
3. The paper for the final presentation
